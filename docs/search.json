    "text": "I am an Evolutionary Biologist with a focus on macroevolution and modelling. I am particularly interested in understanding the levels to which evolution and ecology are predictable and how we can use advances in simulation and statistics to model past and future biodiversity.\nIn September 2024, I will start a Postdoc with Dr. Will Pearse at the Turing Institute building a community around Probabilistic Programming."
