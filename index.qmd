# Research Associate in Probabilistic Programming at the Turing Institute {style="color: #45B39D"}

#### I am an Evolutionary Biologist with a focus on macroevolution and modelling. I am particularly interested in understanding the levels to which evolution and ecology are predictable and how we can use advances in simulation and statistics to model past and future biodiversity. I am currently looking at how Bayesian methods, like PGLMMs, can help elucidate patterns in macroecology and macroevolution. 

#### We are also building a new community around Probabilistic Programming and its applications to Biodiversity, Health and Evolution. Check out [SPHERE-PPL](https://sphere-ppl.github.io/) for more information!
