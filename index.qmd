# Research Associate in Probabilistic Programming at the Turing Institute {style="color: #45B39D"}

#### How predictable are evolution and ecology?  I'm an evolutionary biologist tackling this question by developing advanced statistical models and simulations to analyze past and future biodiversity.  My current focus is on Bayesian approaches, including PGLMMs, to reveal patterns in macroevolution and macroecology. 

#### We are also building a new community around Probabilistic Programming and its applications to Biodiversity, Health and Evolution. Check out [SPHERE-PPL](https://sphere-ppl.org) for more information!
