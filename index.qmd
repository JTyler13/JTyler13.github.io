# Research Associate in Probabilistic Programming at the Turing Institute {style="color: #45B39D"}

#### I am an Evolutionary Biologist with a focus on macroevolution and modelling. I am particularly interested in understanding the levels to which evolution and ecology are predictable and how we can use advances in simulation and statistics to model past and future biodiversity.

#### My current project looks to investigate how probabilistic programming can improve biodiversity function predictions. We are also building a new community around Probabilistic Programming and its applications to Biodiversity, Health and Evolution. This will include the creation of new training resources so watch this space!
