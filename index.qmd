#### I am an Evolutionary Biologist with a focus on macroevolution and modelling. I am particularly interested in understanding the levels to which evolution and ecology are predictable and how we can use advances in simulation and statistics to model past and future biodiversity.

#### In September 2024, I will start a Postdoc with Dr. Will Pearse at the Turing Institute building a community around Probabilistic Programming.
